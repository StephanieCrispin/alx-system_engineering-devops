**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (GMT -5) on March 10, 2024.
- **Impact:** The outage affected 80% of users accessing our cloud-based file storage service. Users experienced complete unavailability of the service, resulting in disrupted workflows and productivity loss.

- **Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on one of the backend servers.

**Timeline:**

- **10:00 AM:** The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in server response times.

- **10:05 AM:** Engineers investigated potential causes, including network issues and server failures.

- **10:15 AM:** Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to network congestion or a DDoS attack.

- **10:30 AM:** Misleading investigation paths led to attempts to mitigate the supposed network issues.

- **10:45 AM:** With no improvement, the incident was escalated to the infrastructure team.

- **11:00 AM:** Further investigation revealed the misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic.

- **11:15 AM:** The load balancer configuration was adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across all backend servers.

- **11:30 AM:** Service was restored, and users regained access to the file storage service.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic, resulting in overloading one of the backend servers.

- **Resolution:** The load balancer configuration was adjusted to evenly distribute traffic, alleviating the overload on the affected server and restoring service functionality.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**

  - Conduct regular audits of load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations.
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect load imbalances and performance issues more effectively.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to ensure adherence to best practices.
  - Develop and document standard operating procedures for load balancer configuration management.
  - Schedule regular training sessions for infrastructure teams on load balancer management and troubleshooting techniques.

**Conclusion:**

The outage experienced on March 10, 2024, underscored the critical importance of robust configuration management practices and proactive monitoring in maintaining service availability. By implementing corrective measures and enhancing preventative measures, we aim to mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future and uphold the reliability and stability of our services.
